## Purpose
This project helps people learn. Due to such a broad scope, it's currently limited to two tasks:  
1. Openly plan and design a project from scratch.  
2. Recommend learning material.  


### Open design
There are many open source projects with an initial commit from an existing code base of 6000 lines of code. That's not open enough to guide people starting new projects. The idea behind **quirio** is an open design from the beginning. Development will be driven by feature requests as issues. Each commit will be an incremental change; making the process easier to follow. There will be ugly mistakes, but the small updates will keep the development story coherent.  

Goals and plans will take place in the wiki. Issues and pull requests will be heavily cross-referenced, and progress will closely follow [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/).

### Learning Recommendation
Amazon has product recommendation. Netflix recommends movies. Google uses AdSense. Commercial applications of recommender systems are easy to find. However, there is yet to be a big implementation of these in education. **quirio** will help people learn the best way they can. It may be difficult to track patterns in learning styles, but given enough data a recommender system can become an expert.

Education for everyone is crucial to all of our well-being. Here's to lowering the barrier to entry.
